<body> While many of the 90's Kids know who Chris Farley is, many of the younger
  generation does not know the amazing Tommy Boy, Chippendales Try-Out and the
  one and only Matt Foley, who lives in a Van down by the River. But even 90's
  kids may not know that Farley was orginally slated to play the beloved
  Shrek. If it were not for his untimely demise, who knows how Shrek would have
  grown into our hearts. Even the concept art changed since the Chris Farley
  rendition of Shrek with Eddie Murphy as Donkey. The video below shows the
  original sketches and dialogue between Donkey and Shrek, and after many revisions
  we have the finished product we know today as Shrek, along with his many sequels.
